pip is a very useful python package and you'll need it many times to perform some tasks !

Steps for installation ! (on linux) (cassez vous le cul les windowsiens)

1- make sure you have the latest version of python
2- apt-get install python3-pip (add sudo if ur not in root mode)
3- pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
4- verify if it was correctly installed by typing (pip3 -V)
